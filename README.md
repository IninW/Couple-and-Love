Study about the factors that contribute to relationship length in love

In this project, we carried out a survey about relationship length and features of couples, asking our respondents to fill out their longest relashipship, and popular features such as age gap, height gap, common interest gap etc. 
Then based on the result of survey, we tried to analyze what kind of couple features contribute to longer relationship. 
Here is the conclusion: 
1. check the frequency distribution in visualization report (word file), most people, in their longest relationship, tend to match in zodiac sign, have similar education level, family background, common interest, spending pattern. In a word, for a particular person, he/she tend to be more similar to his/her couple in the longest relationship. 
2. check the relationship between relationship length and couple features in visualizaiton report, longer relationships feature with big difference within a couple, not match in zodiac sign, big gap in education leval and family background, except for common interest and spending pattern, which still appear to be the more similar, the better. 
3. The final conclusion of the project is: at individual level, similarity contributes more to every individual's own longest relationship. But at a macro level, couples with big difference tend to be the group of longer relationship length, which implies that difference do contributes to better relationship. 
4. Important features in good couple. Features that display consistent performance in both frequency and relationship to dependent variable should be most important in considering relationship quanlity, which are more common interest and similar spending pattern, other features such as zodiac sign, family background, education gap are not so important according to our survey.
